    "question": "How does Type I diabetes differ from Type II diabetes?",
    "context": "Type I diabetes, sometimes called juvenile diabetes, begins most commonly in childhood or adolescence. In this form of diabetes, the body produces little or no insulin. It is characterized by a sudden onset and occurs more frequently in populations descended from northern European countries (Finland, Scotland, Scandinavia) than in those from southern European countries, the Middle East, or Asia.\n\nThe more common form of diabetes, Type II, occurs in approximately 3–5% of Americans under 50 years of age, and increases to 10–15% in those over 50. More than 90% of the diabetics in the United States are Type II diabetics. In 2003, a report noted that nearly one-third of the U.S. population over age 20 has this form of diabetes but remains undiagnosed. Sometimes called age-onset or adult-onset diabetes, this form of diabetes occurs most often in people who are overweight and do not exercise... In Type II diabetes, the pancreas may produce enough insulin, however, cells have become resistant to the insulin produced and it may not work as effectively.",
    "answer": "Type I diabetes, often called juvenile diabetes, usually begins in childhood and involves the body producing little or no insulin. Type II diabetes, or adult-onset diabetes, is more common and occurs when the pancreas may produce enough insulin, but the body's cells become resistant to it.

    "question": "What is the cause of dizziness in relation to the inner ear?",
    "context": "Vision and the body’s senses are the most important systems for maintaining balance, but problems in the inner ear are the most frequent cause of dizziness. The inner ear, also called the vestibular system, contains fluid that helps to fine tune the information the brain receives from the eyes and the body. When fluid volume or pressure in the inner ear changes, information about balance is altered. The discrepancy gives conflicting messages to the brain about balance and induces dizziness.",
    "answer": "Dizziness is frequently caused by problems in the inner ear (vestibular system). This occurs when the volume or pressure of the fluid in the inner ear changes, altering balance information. This discrepancy results in conflicting messages being sent to the brain, which induces dizziness."

    "question": "What are the common causes and triggers of Eczema (atopic dermatitis)?",
    "context": "Genetic predisposition plays a large role in who will get AD or other allergies. The condition is not contagious. A child who has one parent with some form of allergic, or atopic, disease has somewhere between a 25–60% chance of also experiencing allergies, whether AD or some other form... The genetic predisposition of the individual, combined with such factors such as early exposure to strong antigens, will determine whether and to what extent that person will develop allergies. Aside from a predisposition to eczema, increased use of soapy detergents and baby wipes is probably responsible for higher incidence of childhood eczema as well.\n\nThe hallmark sign of AD is a red, itchy rash... Environmental improvement affords some relief for many patients. Pet dander and cigarette smoke are potential aggravating factors... Temperature extremes can make AD worse, so heating and cooling should be employed as appropriate, along with adding humidity if needed. Patients tend to have abnormal regulation of body temperature, and sometimes feel warmer or colder than other people in similar circumstances. Sweating will frequently aggravate AD.",

    "question": "What are the primary therapeutic uses of Eucalyptus oil?",
    "context": "Eucalyptus is most popular for its ability to clear congestion due to colds, coughs, flu, asthma, and sinusitis. The tannins found in eucalyptus have astringent properties that reduce mucous membrane inflammation of the upper respiratory tract. Eucalyptol, the chemical component of the oil, works to loosen phlegm. Cough drops containing eucalyptus promote saliva production, which increases swallowing and lessens the coughing impulse. Earaches can also be treated with eucalyptus... Eucalyptus is a component of many topical arthritis creams and analgesic ointments. When applied to the skin, eucalyptus stimulates blood flow and creates a warm feeling to the area, relieving pain in muscles and joints.",

    "question": "What is the physiological mechanism of a fever?",
    "context": "A fever occurs when the body’s thermostat resets at a higher temperature, which primarily happens in response to an infection. To reach the higher temperature, the body moves blood to the warmer interior, increases the metabolic rate, and induces shivering. The chills that often accompany a fever are caused by the movement of blood to the body’s core, which leaves the surface and extremities cold. Once the body reaches the higher temperature, the shivering and chills stop... Fever is an important component of the immune response... Higher temperatures also inhibit the growth of some bacteria and speed up the chemical reactions that help the body’s cells repair themselves.",
    "answer": "A fever occurs when the body's thermostat resets to a higher temperature in response to infection. The body achieves this by moving blood to the core, increasing metabolic rate, and inducing shivering. This elevated temperature inhibits bacterial growth and speeds up cellular repair chemical reactions."

    "context": "Glaucoma is a slowly progressive eye condition that causes damage to the optic nerve... Glaucoma occurs if there is a build up of the aqueous humor due to poor drainage or overproduction. As the fluid builds up there is increased pressure on the retina at the back of the eye.
